# GSE-One — opencode Install Guide

This document covers **only the opencode-specific install, upgrade, uninstall, and local-model setup**. For what GSE-One is, the list of commands, the architecture, and the full lifecycle, see [README.md](README.md) and [gse-one-spec.md](gse-one-spec.md).

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- **opencode** on your `PATH` — check with `opencode --version`. Install: https://opencode.ai
- **Python 3** — ships with macOS and Linux; on Windows use `python`.
- **git** — to clone this repo.

No Node.js, npm, or Bun install required — opencode runs the TS guardrails plugin itself.

---

## 2. Install

Pick one mode. **Mode A** is simplest for a single project; **Mode B** gives every project access to GSE-One.

### Mode A — Non-plugin (per-project)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nicolasguelfi/gensem.git
cd gensem
python3 install.py --platform opencode --mode no-plugin --project-dir /path/to/your-project
```

Writes `<project>/.opencode/` + `AGENTS.md` + `opencode.json` at the project root. The only file outside the project is a 1-line `~/.gse-one` registry.

### Mode B — Plugin (global, `~/.config/opencode/`)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nicolasguelfi/gensem.git
cd gensem
python3 install.py --platform opencode --mode plugin
```

### Interactive (auto-detects everything)

```bash
python3 install.py
```

After install, launch `opencode` in your project and type `/gse-go`.

---

## 3. Files written

| File | Mode A | Mode B |
|------|:------:|:------:|
| `<project>/.opencode/{skills,commands,agents,plugins}/` | ✓ | — |
| `<project>/AGENTS.md` (GSE block between `<!-- GSE-ONE START -->` / `<!-- GSE-ONE END -->`) | ✓ | — |
| `<project>/opencode.json` (deep-merged) | ✓ | — |
| `~/.config/opencode/{skills,commands,agents,plugins}/` | — | ✓ |
| `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md` | — | ✓ |
| `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (deep-merged) | — | ✓ |
| `~/.gse-one` (1-line path registry) | ✓ | ✓ |

User content outside the GSE-ONE markers is preserved on reinstall and fully restored on uninstall. `opencode.json` deep-merge never overwrites your keys.

---

## 4. Upgrade

```bash
cd /path/to/gensem && git pull
cd gse-one && python3 gse_generate.py --verify
cd .. && python3 install.py --platform opencode --mode <your-mode> [--project-dir /path/to/your-project]
```

Reinstall is idempotent (surgical block replace + deep merge).

---

## 5. Uninstall

```bash
python3 install.py --uninstall --platform opencode --mode <your-mode> [--project-dir /path/to/your-project]
```

`AGENTS.md` loses its GSE block (file deleted if empty); `opencode.json` loses the GSE-added keys (file deleted if only `$schema` remains); `~/.gse-one` is removed.

---

## 6. Run opencode with a local model (Ollama / LM Studio)

opencode talks to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, so Ollama and LM Studio both work out of the box. Use this if you want **privacy**, **zero API cost**, or **offline** operation.

### 6.1 Recommended local coding models (April 2026)

opencode runs an agentic loop with tool calls. A model that can't reliably call tools will silently fail. Pick from this short list — all have been observed to work for opencode-style workflows. **Context window ≥ 64k tokens** is strongly recommended by the opencode docs.

#### 6.1.1 Commodity hardware (8–32 GB)

| Model (Ollama tag) | Params | Min VRAM/RAM | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `qwen3-coder` (a.k.a. Qwen3-Coder-Next) | 80B MoE (3B active) | 8 GB | Best efficiency/quality ratio in 2026; designed for agent tool-calling. |
| `qwen2.5-coder:32b` | 32B dense | 24 GB | Python-first, strong code completion; the default "big local" option. |
| `llama3.3:70b` | 70B dense | 32 GB (Apple Silicon 48 GB+) | GPT-4-class generalist; slower but very strong on full-file edits. |
| `deepseek-r1:14b` | 14B dense | 16 GB | Chain-of-thought; excellent for debugging and code review. |
| `gpt-oss:20b` | 20B dense | 16 GB | OpenAI open-source; enable high-thinking mode for agent reliability. |
| `devstral-small-2:24b` | 24B dense | 16 GB | Good fallback when VRAM is tight; lighter than Qwen Coder 32B. |

**What to avoid for opencode:** Qwen 3 14B (plain), Devstral Small 2 in agent mode, GPT-OSS 20B in default (non-thinking) mode — reports of tool-call failures and instruction drift. Pick a larger or MoE variant if you have the VRAM.

Ollama tags evolve; run `ollama search coder` to see what's current.

#### 6.1.2 High-RAM workstations (≥ 128 GB)

With 128 GB of unified memory (Apple Silicon M3/M4 Max/Ultra) or a PC with 128 GB DDR5 + a capable GPU, you can run the frontier-class open models at quality-preserving quantization. On Apple Silicon, prefer the **MLX** runtime (LM Studio has a toggle; with Ollama stick to its default): it's consistently 20–30 % faster than llama.cpp on large models.

| Model (Ollama tag) | Total / Active | Recommended quant | RAM footprint | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `qwen2.5-coder:72b` | 72B dense | Q8 | ~75 GB | **Best coding specialist at this tier.** Solid tool-calling, Python-first. |
| `llama3.3:70b` at Q8 | 70B dense | Q8 | ~75 GB | Bumping the 32 GB-tier pick to Q8 meaningfully improves complex reasoning and multi-file edits. |
| `deepseek-r1:70b` (distill) | 70B dense | Q8 | ~75 GB | R1-style chain-of-thought at 70B; pair with a coder model for best review/debug results. |
| `mistral-large:123b` | 123B dense | Q5 | ~85 GB | 128k context, strong generalist, well-behaved on tool calls. |
| `llama4-scout` | 109B MoE (17B active) | Q6 | ~85 GB | 10M-token context, multimodal, fast thanks to MoE — leave ~30 GB headroom for context. |
| `qwen3:235b-a22b` | 235B MoE (22B active) | Q4 | ~120 GB | Frontier-class general model; tight on 128 GB — keep context ≤ 32k and close other heavy apps. |

**Still out of reach at 128 GB** (for reference — don't try these without ≥ 180 GB):
- `qwen3-coder:480b-a35b` (Qwen3-Coder-480B) — ~240 GB at Q4, the current best open coding model but needs a multi-GPU rig or a 256 GB Mac Studio.
- `deepseek-v3` / `deepseek-r1:671b` (full 671B MoE) — ~400 GB at Q4; same story.

**Tips for 128 GB setups:**
- Budget 15–25 % of RAM for the KV cache (context) — a 32k context on a 70B model can add 6–10 GB on top of the weights.
- Running two models side-by-side (e.g. Qwen Coder for code + DeepSeek R1 for review) only works up to the combined footprint; unload one with `ollama stop <tag>` or LM Studio's "Eject" button before loading the other if you hit OOM.
- Expect 5–15 tok/s on an M3 Ultra 128 GB with a 70B model at Q8, 3–8 tok/s with a 120 B+ model.

#### 6.1.3 Frontier open-weight models (via a cloud endpoint)

When you need the best open-source quality but don't have the RAM, use opencode's OpenAI-compatible provider config to point at a hosted endpoint (the vendor's API, Together.ai, Groq, OpenRouter, DeepInfra, etc.). These are the current top open-weight models on software-engineering benchmarks (April 2026):

| Model | Org | License | Total / Active | SWE-bench V. | Context | GSE-One fit | Notes for opencode |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|:---:|---|
| **MiniMax M2.5** | MiniMax | open-weight | undisclosed | **80.2 %** | 192 k | ★★★★★ | Current open-weight leader on SWE-bench; strong agentic tool use. |
| **GLM-5** | Zhipu AI | open-weight | undisclosed | 77.8 % | 128 k | ★★★★★ | Top scorer on SWE-bench Pro and Terminal Bench among open models. |
| **Kimi K2.5** | Moonshot AI | open-weight | ~1 T MoE | 76.8 % | 256 k | ★★★★☆ | Excellent on competitive programming and front-end work; longest context of the table. |
| **Step-3.5-Flash** | StepFun | open-weight | undisclosed | 74.4 % | 128 k | ★★★☆☆ | Balanced all-rounder; faster/cheaper than the 1 T-class models. |
| **GLM-4.7** | Zhipu AI | open-weight | undisclosed | 73.8 % | 128 k | ★★★★☆ | "Cleanest all-around coding profile" in community reviews; 94.2 HumanEval. |
| **DeepSeek V3.2** | DeepSeek | open-weight | 671 B MoE (37 B active) | ~72–74 % | 128 k | ★★★★★ | Workhorse: 90 % of frontier quality at a fraction of the cost. Strong multilingual (SWE-Multilingual 70 %). |
| **Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B** | Alibaba | Apache-2.0 | 480 B MoE (35 B active) | SWE-Pro 38.7 % | 256 k | ★★★☆☆ | Best **pure** open coding specialist; weaker on full SWE-Verified → pair with a reviewer model. |
| **DeepSeek R1** (full) | DeepSeek | MIT | 671 B MoE | 49.2 % | 128 k | ★★★☆☆ | Not a coder — use as the "reviewer" model for `/gse-review` / `/gse-design`: its chain-of-thought catches issues coder models miss. |

**How to point opencode at any of these:** add a provider block to `opencode.json` using the same `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` pattern shown in §6.2, but replace `baseURL` with the endpoint URL of your chosen host (e.g. `https://api.deepseek.com/v1`, `https://api.together.xyz/v1`, `https://api.moonshot.cn/v1`). Put the API key in the hosted-provider's way (usually `options.apiKey` or an env variable). Once configured, `/models` in opencode lets you switch between local and cloud endpoints on the fly.

**Recommendations for GSE-One users:**

- **Solo development / cost-sensitive:** pair a strong local coder (e.g. Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B from §6.1.1 or 72B from §6.1.2) for `/gse-produce`, `/gse-fix`, with a cloud reasoner (DeepSeek V3.2 or R1) for `/gse-review`, `/gse-design`. The `opencode` `variant_cycle` keybind makes switching fast.
- **Privacy-critical / offline:** stick to §6.1.1 or §6.1.2 entirely — no data leaves the machine.
- **Best agentic quality, don't care about cost:** use MiniMax M2.5 or GLM-5 via their hosted API. The GSE-One guardrails still work identically since they're enforced by the opencode TS plugin, not the model.

Scores above come from vendor reports and community benchmarks as of April 2026; numbers evolve fast — recheck the [Scale SWE-Bench Pro Leaderboard](https://labs.scale.com/leaderboard/swe_bench_pro_public) and [SWE-bench.com](https://www.swebench.com/) before committing to a stack.

#### 6.1.4 Via OpenRouter (unified gateway)

[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) aggregates 300+ models behind a single OpenAI-compatible endpoint, so you only manage one API key and can switch between models with `/models` in opencode. Especially handy when you want to A/B a coder against a reviewer, or try a model for a session without opening another vendor account.

**Config snippet** — add to `opencode.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "provider": {
    "openrouter": {
      "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
      "name": "OpenRouter",
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
        "apiKey": "{env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY}"
      },
      "models": {
        "anthropic/claude-opus-4.7":    { "name": "Claude Opus 4.7" },
        "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6":  { "name": "Claude Sonnet 4.6" },
        "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5":   { "name": "Claude Haiku 4.5" },
        "mistralai/codestral-2508":     { "name": "Codestral 25.08 (Mistral)" },
        "mistralai/devstral-2512":      { "name": "Devstral 2512 (Mistral)" },
        "qwen/qwen3-coder":             { "name": "Qwen3 Coder 480B" },
        "deepseek/deepseek-v3.2":       { "name": "DeepSeek V3.2" },
        "minimax/minimax-m2.5":         { "name": "MiniMax M2.5" },
        "z-ai/glm-4.5":                 { "name": "GLM-4.5 (Zhipu)" },
        "moonshotai/kimi-k2.5":         { "name": "Kimi K2.5 (Moonshot)" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then `export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...` before launching opencode, or put the literal key in `apiKey` (less safe).

**Best SWE / coding models on OpenRouter (April 2026):**

| OpenRouter ID | License | SWE-bench V. | Context | Input $/M | Output $/M | GSE-One fit | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|:---:|---|
| `anthropic/claude-opus-4.7` | proprietary | **87.6 %** | 1 M | $5.00 | $25.00 | ★★★★★ | **Highest SWE-bench Verified of any model in this table.** Built for long-running async agents; default when quality > cost (`/gse-review`, `/gse-design`, complex `/gse-fix`). |
| `minimax/minimax-m2.5` | open-weight | 80.2 % | 197 k | $0.12 | $0.99 | ★★★★★ | Best open-weight SWE score × best price — the default "good and cheap" pick. |
| `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6` | proprietary | 79.6 % | 1 M | $3.00 | $15.00 | ★★★★★ | The best quality/price in the Claude line; 1 M context avoids chunking. Strong default coder for the full GSE-One lifecycle. |
| `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5` | proprietary | > 73 % | 200 k | $1.00 | $5.00 | ★★★★☆ | Near-frontier quality at Haiku price; ideal for fast iteration (`/gse-status`, `/gse-go`, routine `/gse-produce`). 200 k context is a minor limitation vs Sonnet/Opus. |
| `z-ai/glm-4.5` | open-weight | ~74 % (4.5) / **77.8 %** (GLM-5) | 128 k | $0.60 | $2.20 | ★★★★☆ | Top open-weight on SWE-bench Pro and Terminal Bench. Check for `z-ai/glm-5` when listed — same ID pattern. |
| `deepseek/deepseek-v3.2` | open-weight (MIT) | ~72–74 % | 164 k | $0.26 | $0.42 | ★★★★★ | Workhorse: 90 % of Sonnet quality for 2 % of the cost. Ideal default for `/gse-produce`. |
| `mistralai/devstral-medium` | proprietary | 61.6 % | 128 k | $0.40 | $2.00 | ★★★★☆ | Mistral's dedicated agentic coder. Beats Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4.1 on SWE-bench. |
| `mistralai/devstral-2512` | open-weight (Apache-2.0) | ~60 % | 256 k | $0.40 | $2.00 | ★★★★☆ | **State-of-the-art open agentic coding model.** Long context, strong tool use. |
| `qwen/qwen3-coder` | Apache-2.0 | SWE-Pro ~39 % | 262 k | $0.22 | $1.00 | ★★★☆☆ | Cheapest frontier open coding model; 480 B MoE / 35 B active. Weak on full SWE — good for `/gse-produce`, not `/gse-review`. Free tier (`qwen/qwen3-coder:free`) with tighter rate limits. |
| `moonshotai/kimi-k2.5` | open-weight | 76.8 % | 256 k | ~$0.30 | ~$1.20 | ★★★★☆ | Front-end specialist; 85 % on LiveCodeBench; 256 k context is comfortable for GSE-One's AGENTS.md overhead. |
| **`mistralai/codestral-2508`** | proprietary | ~2 % (SWE-Pro) | 256 k | $0.30 | $0.90 | ★★☆☆☆ | **Fill-in-the-middle specialist.** Not for full agentic flows — niche use only (inline completion inside an existing file). 86.6 % HumanEval, 91.2 % MBPP. |
| `mistralai/mistral-large-2512` | proprietary | ~65 % | 262 k | $0.50 | $1.50 | ★★★☆☆ | General-purpose strong all-rounder with very long context; less specialized than Devstral Medium for coding agents. |
| `mistralai/devstral-small` | open-weight (Apache-2.0) | ~55 % | 128 k | $0.10 | $0.30 | ★★★☆☆ | Cheapest agentic coder on OpenRouter; degrades on multi-file edits — fine for small projects only. |

> **Legend — GSE-One fit stars:** ★★★★★ excellent across all 23 activities (default pick) · ★★★★☆ strong, minor tradeoff (e.g. shorter context, one weaker activity) · ★★★☆☆ works for a subset of activities (pair with a complementary model) · ★★☆☆☆ niche only — not recommended as primary · ★☆☆☆☆ avoid for GSE-One. Ratings weight **tool-calling reliability**, **context ≥ 128 k**, **SWE-bench Verified**, and **multi-step reasoning** — the four capabilities GSE-One relies on for its full lifecycle.

Prices are per 1 M tokens; "proprietary" models may offer free tiers or OpenRouter credits — recheck on the provider page.

**Picking for GSE-One:**

- **Absolute top quality, cost no object:** `anthropic/claude-opus-4.7` — 87.6 % SWE-Verified leads the table by ~7 points. Use for `/gse-review`, `/gse-design`, and any architectural/long-running work.
- **Best quality/price on Claude:** `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6` — 79.6 % SWE with 1 M context; strong default coder that also handles review well.
- **Best open-weight, cheap:** `minimax/minimax-m2.5` — 80.2 % SWE at < $1 per 1 M output; the default "good and cheap" pick.
- **Workhorse for `/gse-produce`:** `deepseek/deepseek-v3.2` — 90 % of Sonnet quality for ~5 % of the cost. Pair it with Opus or Sonnet for review.
- **Fast & cheap for routine flow:** `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5` (`/gse-status`, `/gse-go`, simple `/gse-produce`).
- **If you specifically want Mistral:** `mistralai/devstral-medium` for agentic work; reserve `mistralai/codestral-2508` for inline completions (it's not a full agentic model).
- **Per-activity split (advanced):** use opencode's `variant_cycle` keybind to jump between a cheap coder for `/gse-produce` (DeepSeek V3.2 or Haiku 4.5) and a strong reviewer for `/gse-review` (Opus 4.7 or Sonnet 4.6).

### 6.2 Option A — Ollama

```bash
# Install Ollama (macOS example)
brew install ollama
ollama serve &                       # background server on :11434

# Pull one of the recommended models
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:32b        # or qwen3-coder, llama3.3:70b, etc.
```

Then add an Ollama provider to your opencode config. In **Mode A** edit `<project>/opencode.json`, in **Mode B** edit `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "provider": {
    "ollama": {
      "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
      "name": "Ollama (local)",
      "options": { "baseURL": "http://localhost:11434/v1" },
      "models": {
        "qwen2.5-coder:32b": { "name": "Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Launch opencode and type `/models` → pick **Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B**. To make it the default, add `"model": "ollama/qwen2.5-coder:32b"` at the top level of `opencode.json`.

> **Shortcut:** if you're on Ollama ≥ 0.5, `ollama launch opencode` passes a ready-made config via `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT` and deep-merges with your existing `opencode.json`.

### 6.3 Option B — LM Studio

1. Install LM Studio: https://lmstudio.ai
2. Download a recommended model from the Models tab (Qwen Coder, DeepSeek R1, etc.).
3. Open the **Developer** tab → **Start Server** (default port `1234`). Ensure the model is loaded.

Add the provider to `opencode.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "provider": {
    "lmstudio": {
      "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
      "name": "LM Studio (local)",
      "options": { "baseURL": "http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1" },
      "models": {
        "qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct": { "name": "Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B (LM Studio)" }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace the model ID with whatever LM Studio reports for your loaded model (see its "Local Server" panel). In opencode: `/models` → LM Studio → pick it. No real API key is required; if prompted, enter any non-empty string.

### 6.4 Tuning for GSE-One agentic flow

- **Context ≥ 64k.** GSE-One loads the orchestrator body (~400 lines of methodology) into every session via `AGENTS.md`. Smaller contexts truncate it.
- **Temperature low.** `0.0–0.3` for deterministic tool calls. Most local engines respect `options.temperature` in the provider block.
- **Tool calling must be on.** Ollama exposes it by default for compatible models; LM Studio exposes it when you tick "Function Calling" in the server panel.
- **Watch VRAM.** The orchestrator + 1-2 open files + a long conversation can push past 32 GB on the 70B models. If the model starts hallucinating, check you're not being silently evicted to disk swap.
- **`websearch` needs a key when running local.** opencode's built-in `websearch` tool is only active when you use opencode's own cloud provider, **or** when you export `OPENCODE_ENABLE_EXA=1` plus an [Exa](https://exa.ai) API key (`EXA_API_KEY`). With Ollama or LM Studio alone, `websearch` is silently unavailable. `webfetch` (direct HTTP) works in all cases, so GSE-One activities that need to read a specific URL still run. Example shell setup:
  ```bash
  export OPENCODE_ENABLE_EXA=1
  export EXA_API_KEY=xxx   # from https://exa.ai
  ```

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

- **`/gse-*` commands missing** — check the `commands/` dir exists at the install target. Restart opencode.
- **Model ignores GSE-One methodology** — `AGENTS.md` lost its GSE block; reinstall. Or context window too small (try ≥ 64k).
- **"Skill skipped: missing name/description"** — regenerate: `cd gse-one && python3 gse_generate.py --verify`.
- **Guardrails don't fire on `git commit` on main** — `plugins/gse-guardrails.ts` missing or opencode version doesn't support `tool.execute.before`. Upgrade opencode.
- **Local model makes tool calls but never finishes the loop** — model is too weak for agentic work. Swap for a larger variant or one from §6.1.
- **`.claude/skills/` + `.opencode/skills/` coexist** — opencode loads both → duplicate commands. Installer warns at install time; remove one of the two.
